Special thanks to KidsCanCode
He really got me started with programming in pygame and I used his tutorials as a starting point to build on for this game.
# Souces: Tilemap Demo, Shmup, and Jumpy

Also, I'd like to say thank you to everyone in the pygame discord group:
https://discordapp.com/channels/349505959032389632/423510449703878656
They are the absolute best and have helped offer a lot of advice and programming wisdom which has enabled me to fix a lot of bugs and streamline various things in my code.

Thanks to Kenny for providing the game art I used in early demos... though I don't think I'm using any of it anymore:
