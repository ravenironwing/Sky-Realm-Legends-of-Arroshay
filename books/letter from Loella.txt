	Hi Daddy! Me and mommy miss you so much. You have been gone for so long. Do you know when you will be coming home? Mommy keeps telling me that we should catch some fish for our tank, but I wanted to wait for you to come home so we can catch them together.
	Is the war hard? They say it’s almost over. Have you killed lots of demons? Can you bring me back one of their horns? Bethany from school says her dad brought her back a demon horn and that it’s magic. Is that true Daddy, are they magic?
	But I don’t really care about any of that. I just want you to come home safe. Please come home soon. Mommy and I miss you so much! We miss you more than anything.

	Love,

	Loella and Mommy
