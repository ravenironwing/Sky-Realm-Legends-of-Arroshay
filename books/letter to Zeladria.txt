	Your highness, it has been ages since I have heard from you or your people. I hope that everything is well with you, but I must confess I am concerned. I know that since our parting four years ago things have not been the same between our peoples, and I can only blame myself for that.
	The demon wars were long and gruesome, but they united our people under a common cause to fight a common enemy. Now that the war has been won and the demons sent back to the underworld is there nothing remaining to unite our kingdoms, and our hearts?
	Yet, I should not let my feelings for you interfere with the purpose of my letter. I am hoping that we can set aside our differences and once again open up trade and peaceful exchanges between our peoples.
	I know that you do not wish to see me again, but if you are willing to negotiate a trade agreement between our peoples I will send Lissig, my most trusted ambassador to negotiate in my place.
	If by chance your silence is caused by any misfortune that has befallen your people then please don’t hesitate to tell me and I will send assistance. I fear something is not right in the land. The bodies of our dead have begun to rise. They have no memories of their former lives and are filled with dark spirits. They cannot be reasoned with and lust to eat our flesh. I fear that a similar darkness may have befallen you.
	Please be safe.

	Sincerely,

	Bray Draconius
